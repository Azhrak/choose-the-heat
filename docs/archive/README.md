# Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been migrated to the new feature-centric structure as part of the documentation reorganization completed on 2025-12-09.

## Migration Information

As part of our documentation refactoring project, we moved from a type-centric structure (technical/, development/) to a feature-centric structure (features/). All archived files have been migrated to their new locations with enhanced content following our standardized feature documentation template.

### Archived Files

| Original File | Migrated To | Migration Date |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| `TEXT_TO_SPEECH.md` | [features/text-to-speech.md](../features/text-to-speech.md) | 2025-12-09 |
| `ADMIN.md` | [features/admin-dashboard.md](../features/admin-dashboard.md) | 2025-12-09 |
| `SCENE_METADATA.md` | [features/ai-story-generation.md](../features/ai-story-generation.md) | 2025-12-09 |

### Why Files Were Moved

The documentation reorganization aimed to:

1. **Feature-Centric Structure**: Organize docs by user-facing features rather than technical type
2. **Standardized Template**: Apply consistent 14-section template for all features
3. **AI Maintainability**: Include update triggers and maintenance patterns for AI coding assistants
4. **Improved Navigation**: Make it easier to find complete information about a feature in one place
5. **Better Cross-References**: Add clear dependencies and integration points between features

### Using Archived Files
